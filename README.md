# AHBA Research

Welcome to the **AHBA Research** project! This project aims to leverage data from the **Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA)** to develop machine learning models that map brain regions to diseases. By utilizing gene expression data and MRI images, we aim to uncover insights into how specific brain regions are associated with various neurological conditions.

## Project Overview

The AHBA Research project focuses on:
- **Data Acquisition and Processing:** Collecting and organizing data from the AHBA.
- **Data Integration:** Combining gene expression data with MRI imaging.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Building predictive models to map brain regions to specific diseases.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Analyzing gene expression patterns and visualizing spatial gene distribution.

## AHBA Data Acquisition Notes

All data acquisition steps are documented in the **AHBA Data Acquisition Notes**. This file contains detailed information on how data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas is retrieved, processed, and organized for analysis. It includes:
- Instructions on how to fetch gene expression data.
- Documentation on RNA-seq, microarray, MRI, and gene group data.
- Practical applications and examples of data usage.
- Details on data structure and file formats.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and open the **AHBA Data Acquisition Notes** file to follow the setup instructions.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required libraries: `abagen`, `nibabel`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `ipywidgets`

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcruz0828/AHBA-Research.git
cd AHBA-Research
```

### Usage
Follow the instructions in the **AHBA Data Acquisition Notes** to download and process the AHBA data. Once the data is prepared, you can start experimenting with machine learning models to predict disease associations based on brain region data.
